Given an array h representing heights of buildings. You have to count the buildings which will see the sunrise (Assume : Sun rise on the side of array starting point).

Input
line 1: contains an integer n denoting size of array.

line 2: contains n spaced integers denoting elements of array.

Output
Print a single integer denoting the number of buildings which will see the sunrise.

Constraints
1<=n<=10^6

1<=h[i]<=10^9

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)

Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

Sample Input
5
7 4 8 2 9
Sample Output
3

import java.util.*;
public class Main
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		int n = sc.nextInt();
		int [] arr = new int[n];
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
		    arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
		}
		int count = 0;
		int height = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
		for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
		    if(arr[i]>height){
		        count++;
		        height=arr[i];
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(count);
	}
}
