Given the 3 sides of a triangle, find out whether it is acute-angled, right-angled, or obtuse-angled.
You need to output 1 for acute, 2 for right-angled, and 3 for an obtuse-angled triangle. You can assume that the input values always form a triangle and are valid integers.
Note:
A triangle is acute-angled, if twice the square of the largest side is less than the sum of squares of all the sides.
A triangle is obtuse-angled, if twice the square of its largest side is greater than the sum of squares of all the sides.
A triangle is right-angled, if twice the square of its largest side is exactly equal to the sum of squares of all the sides.
Input:
3 4 5
Output:
2
Explanation:
Since 2x5x5 is equal to 5x5 + 3x3 + 4x4, So this is a right-angled triangle and hence, the answer is 2.

Input:
3 3 3
Output:
1
Explanation:
Since 2x3x3 is less than 3x3 + 3x3 + 3x3, So this is an acute-angled triangle and hence, the answer is 1.
