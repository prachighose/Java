/* Write a program that finds out HCF of two numbers a and b.
What Is HCF? HCF or Highest Common Factor is the greatest common divisor between two numbers.
For example: Let there be two arbitrary numbers such as 75 and 90.
75 = 3 * 5 * 5
90 = 2 * 3 * 3 * 5
Common Divisor = 3 * 5 = 15
Here, the HCF of the three given numbers would be 15 since it divides every given number without leaving a fraction behind. */
