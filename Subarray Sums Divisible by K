Given an integer array nums and an integer k, print the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by k.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
Input:
The first line contains a two integers n(size of array n) and k Second line contains n spaced integers

Output:
Print count of subarrays divisible by k

Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
2 <= k <= 10^4

Sample Input 1
6 5 
4 5 0 -2 -3 1

Sample Output 1
7

Explanation
There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5: [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]

Sample Input 2
1 9
5
Sample Output 2
0
