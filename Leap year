Given a year, find if it is a leap year. A Leap year is the year that is multiple of 4. But, multiples of 100 which are not multiples of 400 are not leap years.
User Task:
Input consists of the year value as an int. You need to print 1 in case of leap year and 0 otherwise.
Sample Input:
2004
Sample Output:
1
Sample Input:
1900
Sample Output:
0
Explanation:
Since 1900 is divisible by 100 but not divisible by 400, so it is not a leap year.
