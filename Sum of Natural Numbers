/* For an integer N, your task is to calculate the sum of first N natural numbers. 
Input User Task: Since this will be a functional problem, you donot have to worry about input. 
You just have to complete the function NumberSum() which takes the integer(large value possible) N as a parameter.
Constraints: 1 <= N < = 100000000 
Output: Print the sum of first N natural numbers.
Example:
Input 5 Output 15
Input 1 Output 1

Logic: sum of natural number can be larger value so have to initialize sum as long.
       can take input using long also.
