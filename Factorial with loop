/*  Find factorial of a given number where n! = n * n-1 * n-2 .....* 1.
Input: First-line consists of a single integer denoting n.
Constraints
0 <= n <= 20
Output: Output is a single line containing factorial(n)
Example:
Sample Input
5
Sample Output
120
Explanation
5! = 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

Logic: if we take fact as int we can give input maximum upto 20, after that it'll show negative value. for 21 it'll show output negative value. and after 33 it'll
show 0 as output. because it considers the number as long number. that's why we have to use long as fact for getting positive output.
